\section{Sample Queries}
All GCX bundles contain either the sources or the binary and a \emph{set of sample queries} with corresponding query-depending \emph{XML documents}. These sample queries including the corresponding XML document can be found~-- sorted by XML categories~-- in subdirectories of the \emph{examples} folder (see also the directory listing in \autoref{dirtree_(installation):using_the_binaries}).
