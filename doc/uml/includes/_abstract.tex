\noindent The G(arbage) C(ollected) X(Query) engine is the first streaming XQuery engine that implements active garbage collection, a novel buffer management strategy in which both static and dynamic analysis are exploited. This technique actively purges main memory buffers at runtime based on the current status of query evaluation. This approach aims at both keeping main memory consumption low at runtime and speeding up query evaluation. For detailed information on active garbage collection in XQuery engines please visit the GCX project homepage at
